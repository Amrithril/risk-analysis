### EUvsVirus Hackathon
Environmental Risk and Heatmap Development using PyKrige Kriging modelling method
  - This section contains raw datasets for Kriging model development
  - Dataset variables (x,y,z) will consist of  **LONGITUDE** (x), **LATITUDE**  (y) and **HOTSPOT** (z) to generate  2D interpolation and visualisation of live hotspots in Sweden based on user-input postal codes.
  - Datum used for all **LAT** (x) and **LONG** (y) is **WGS 84 EPSG:3857 Pseudo-Mercator** (Same datum as Google Maps and Bing Maps)

### Datasets

This repository includes main source files to compute Environmental impacts. 

- [`city_stat`](./city_stat.ipynb) should be re-executed every hour to get the most updated number of "death", "infected", and "intensive_care" per city, to update [city_stat.csv](./city_stat.csv). Data will be fetched from [Folkhälsomyndigheten](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/09f821667ce64bf7be6f9f87457ed9aa).

- [municipality_stat.csv](./municipality_stat.csv) includes risk factors per municipality in greater Stockholm area. 

- [population_municipality.csv](population_municipality.csv) and [population_county.csv](population_county.csv) inlcude updated number or residents in various municipalities and counties in Sweden, obtained from [Statistikdatabasen](http://www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se/pxweb/en/ssd/), and reformatted in our data frame using [`population_to_csv`](population_to_csv.ipynb) script.
- County-and-municipality-and-area-codes focuses on deriving area codes of Sweden counties and municipalities (Statistiska centralbyrån)
- Get_swe_geocoding.ipynb script obtains the geocoding API along with the necessary **LON** and **LAT** locations for (x,y) data. This produces swe_geocoding.csv
- population_to_csv.ipynb script focuses on compiling total area codes and municipalities data, and geolocation into .csv format

### Hotspot Calculation for z value for Kriging model
Hotspot geospatial model will reflect the average number of infected per area i.e. per county. Simple linear equation to approximate per municipality using **LON** and **LAT** .csv coded with Kriging model with PyKrige fo fine-grained estimation. Below is the equation to reflect the z values estimation.  

```python 
The number of cases per municipality is our score/value to that point. we have the official values per county. We approximate per municipality using populations. Denote by
- $P_{ij}$ = population of municipality $i$ of city $j$
- $N_{ij}$ = value of municipality i of city j$
- $P_j$ = population of city $j = \sum_i P_{ij}$
- $N_j$ = value of city $j$ (number of infected)

Then, we have $N_{ij} = Nj Pij/Pj$

```
