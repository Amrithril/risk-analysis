### Hotspot Development for Live Maps
Environmental Hotspots Development as a measure of environmental risk live map based on user-input area codes for location is then connected to Covid19 infected datasets and modelled using PyKrige Kriging modelling method. We had also a better clarity towards approaching and defining risk over predictive modelling versus developing hotspots over live datasets as well the importance of taking plenty of care developing models that may have substantial influence public perception towards engaging in risk factors during Covid19 pandemic.
  - **This section contains 3 folders consisting of:**
    
    - **Environmental** 
        Geocoding of API sourcing live datasets and preliminary development to Kriging 2D interpolation model using live datasets to form live mapping visualisation are included in this folder  
     - **Symptoms**
        From user input data from our We Care app and desktop interface, this section will, in future, focus on better developing and fine tune hotspot details for live map

        From user input data from our We Care app and desktop interface, this section will, in future, focus on better developing and fine tune hotspot details for live map

### Developing Hotspots
We were fortunate to have spoken directly towards Skill Mentor **Alise. E (MD, ID, IM specialist / Epidemiology / WGS / IT in healthcare)** that gave us a more thorough and better insights towards developing live mapping of datasets and the use of realtime vs prediction models.

To best summarise the conversation with Alise here with dotpoints :
- Risk can be approached in two ways, **risk estimation after the exposure** or **overall risk for every individual**
- **Odd's Ratio use must take into account a lot of factors** If we choose to do the Odd's Ratio as part of our model, we have to predict and calculate the % of asymptomatic people in society etc.
- KI and Swiss Institute collaboration with Alise have developed a **scenario-testing mathematical model**  [(Covid19 Scenarios)](http:/https://covid19-scenarios.org//) that focuses on Population, Epidemiology and Mitigation information, which gives a  prediction model. This model was based on model assumptions and parameter choices and therefore are not medical predictors.
- They are working on a **state-wise risk prediction model** and it is important to be careful in adapting risk definitions into live mapping tools. **Hotspots using live dataset modelling** has been encouraged as opposed to trying to characterise and predict risk models. Our duty to reporting accurate and reliable information to the public is the main focus on the development of this prototype. 
- Within the EUvsVirus Hackathon, we chose to actively shift from prediction models towards **incorporating daily monitoring from user inputs** 
- The live hotspot model that is in the "Environment" folder will focus on  incorporating datasets to questions such as:
    - **How may people are sick in Sweden?**
    - **Are numbers of infected and fatalities are going up or going down?**
    - **How many are in the ICU?**
    - **What are the concentration of hotspots that can be described from data?**
- Therefore, continuing development towards the use of live datasets with Kriging 2D interpolation model for better live mapping visualisation is used in this section of our project.
